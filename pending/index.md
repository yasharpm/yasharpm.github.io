## Mainstream projects

### SOS
Soul OS is an operating system for self-actualization! The structure of the OS makes it possible to create light weight apps at a quarter the parice and half the time.

#### Resources
- [Business model & plan in Farsi](/SoulSystem.pdf)

### Open news
A news based app which uses blockchain contracts as its back-end which will make it censor proof. The news are provided by ordinary members and highlighted by vote. The software has a tamper proof structure and user access is controlled using the Authorization grid.

### Authorization grid
In the form of an auxiliary project. Authorization grid is a blockchain contract that allows people to invite others in a tree like structure (which can be enforced by multiple referrals). The newly invited people can get access to the services while their predecessors monitor their behavior and can revoke the access of a whole subtree of theirs.

### Coalescence economy contract
Is a blockchain contract that applies the rules of the coalescence economy (I gave it this name at the moment of writing!). In this model, the income is distributed among team members proportionate to a share value which has been agreed upon using a just consensus mechanism.

### Reputation contract
Enables trust in review and comments on a service or product. It is implemented as a blockchain contract. People have a certain chance to get the right to review someone only if they have purchased a service from them. For each transaction, people win review points. And for submitting a review that is different from the average you'd have to spend more of your review points.


## Side ideas

### Human Milk
A company that specializes in providing human milk diary products.

### Easy breakfast
I should actually patent this idea before talking about it! This idea revolutionizes how people eat breakfast. Specially airlines and transportation services would be interested in this.

### VR art gallery
There is a an empty room or a hall. People buy tickets to visit this room. Before entering they put on their VR goggles. Inside the virual room people can walk around and appreciate the 3D virtual artworks there. Artists are provided with tools to the painting and they authorize the use of their artwork under specific conditions.

### Birds garden & shelter
A medium sized piece of land which has been tailored into a relaxing park with a high web ceiling to prevent birds from getting away. It is actually a bird sanctuary which people can bring their pet birds to live there. Visitors pay to relax in the park which will be used to take are of the birds.

### Ethereum contract corp
A corporation specialized in creating Ethereum contracts for super sensitive large scale international trades. The guarantee goes beyond international law enforcement.

## Not so good ideas

### Vegtables in a pot
The vegtales people usually use in their cooking are sold in a pot so they can harvest it and always consume free and fresh vegtables.

### Instant dried food
For the food that is usually made in a liquid form like soups, Iranian ash, Balghoor, Iranian rice deserts. The ingredients are dried and mixed in a package. The consumers boil it in water and the food is ready.

### Free icecream advertising van
An icecream van that gives out icecream for free. It becomes popular and people are always looking for it. Hence the advertisements on the van will be worth selling. The model can expand into franchised free products maybe even from the advertisers.

### Truth or dare show
It starts with a show. Maybe an instagram page. The actor goes to random shop keepers and lets them try to sweet talk them. The actors drives the conversation into a dare. After the shop keeper agrees, the experts come in to actually test the product. If the show is successful, it can grow into a new standard brand which people actually trust.

### Fortuneteller buster
Similar to the truth or dare show or the ghost busters but with the fortuetellers.

### International trades
Importing/exporting goods has always been a straight forward way to make a ton of money. Why bend backwards?
