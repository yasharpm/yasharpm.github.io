# Introduction

The following article is not meant to prove a point. Rather it is a set of arguments that describe the writer's personal view of the world, its problems and how to solve them. The purpose of this article is to introduce the grounds and philosophy based on which a coalescence may form.

Each argument/topic can be read independently from the others. So feel free to browse around to jump to whichever topic that interests you.

# What is wrong

## Central power

Central point of control for governance works, but it is not good enough. By having a central power or centralization, I mean having a single person or group of people making the decisions for others. It can be in the form of a CEO for a company or a prime minister choosing his ministers. In both examples a single position of power is defined and is entrusted to an individual to make the right decisions for the body they are governing.

Central power works like a chain of command. Because one person's will has be applied, that person has a number of people around to carry on the wishes. And in turn they have their own. To make sure that the wishes are applied and are inline, it should also work in reverse. Meaning for every matter, a single person or a chain of people have to be responsible.

This very fact, forces every element in the system to be structured this way. So every company, every restaurant, every shop have to have someone responsible. And that responsible person has to acquire a permit for their activity. This ensures that the will of the governor is being met and if something diverges, there will be a single person to punish or a single point to adjust.

Centralization creates single points of failure for the entire system (imagine the president being corrupt or manipulated) and induces growth and reaction bottlenecks (since everything specially the important stuff! has to go through a single person who has limited attention and availability).

However rejecting centralization without bringing forth a better solution is more like nagging! The better solution is called decentralization which is discussed under the "what is right" topic.

### Problem in coordination

Coordinating a relatively small group of people using a single person as the manager works. But when it comes to larger scales, the communication, especially the inherent need to monitor and control, becomes a problem. In both directions, for the commands to reach from top to bottom and for the feedback to come from the bottom to top.

When there is a change in law or policy, this change should be delivered down through the command chain. Along the path there is the problem of interpretation because the change instructions are delivered through some medium and no matter how careful, there is always some loss in the meaning of what the change is. Spending more effort on clearing the specification, means less time to address other issues. And the longer the chain of command, there will be more delay and error in application.

A system is meant to react to its environment and the input about the environment comes from the bottom of the chain of command. Two issues exist here. First is similar to the top down problem in which the interpretation of the nature of the problem is distorted along the chain. Second is that a need for a change in laws or policy, means some behavior is considered a deviation and possibly punishable which is actually right and the current guideline is actually wrong. This contradiction generates extra friction and dishonestly and causes distrust between the ruler and the ruled.

### Power play

Power play is a side effect of centralized systems. It inevitably creates corruption in both the ruler and ruled.

#### Corruption of the ruler

As long as there is a position of power, there is someone (arguably with mental health issues) yearning for it. The thirst for power have various causes. One of them is that the individual has a deep feeling of insecurity or unsafe and seeks power thinking after getting more power they can achieve security. Another one is looking for validation or the need to be loved, usually happens in people who have not received enough love in their childhood. Believing that power can make others love them, they do whatever they can to achieve power. The fact that in almost every application of centralization, the ruler has financial benefits, does not help either.

Since in a centralized system, there are very few positions of power and the fact that people usually don't closely know their candidates for ruling, it creates competition and room for dishonesty. In this kind of competition, the one who cares more about the power than the responsibility has more chance to win. Simply because the responsibility in itself is a heavy burden and the one who cares more about the power can act defeat the competition by dirty play like acting confident that they can solve every problem.

The highest position of power has the highest competition, which means you are almost guaranteed that you will never get an host caring person for the most critical responsibility.

#### Corruption of the ruled

While there is a single person who makes the key decisions that affect's people's lives, the subjects of this ruler will naturally try to convince this person towards their own opinion and agenda. This leads to an influence competition. People will either try to win the ruler's favor or manipulate through threats and imposing fear. Even when the ruler means the best, this very fact and behavior does not allow the ruler to think straight and reduces performance. Other than this, power and manipulation and dishonesty become skills and a values among the population which is damaging in the short and in the long term.

### Responsibility and expertise

Ideally you want the person that makes decisions for a subject, be an expert in that area. Or a group of experts make that decision. But the need that centralized systems have to have someone responsible, eliminates this possibility. The person who is responsible decides who the experts are. And how good they actually perform, is subject to the central power's preferences and intelligence. Ideally you don't want that.

The fact that having someone responsible has taken precedence over having an expert, is sad. A king / a dictator likes this because it is mostly at the expense of the weakest and serves the ruling class.

We could break the need to have someone responsible by limiting the impact of mistakes so that we wouldn't worry so much about mal behavior. This can be done by enabling the experts to act only locally by the blessing of the group that is involved with them. And coordinated larger scale changes can only be made by consensus among the collective of the experts which minimizes the risk for making mistakes. But more on this on "what is right". 

## Wage labor

To sell your work for a specific amount of money. By definition you are guaranteed to receive less than the value of your work. Unless the person who hired you doesn't want any profit, their profit is the actual difference between how much you are paid and how much value your work produces. Hence you can see why your employer always tries to work you as much as they can as pay you as little as they can.

### Shielded from harshness or ridiculed into obedience?

One of the arguments pro the wage labor is saying that the hiring person is taking on the risk of not knowing whether the job will be profitable or not. Whereas the hired person is guaranteed to be paid and is shielded from the chaos and the unpredictability of the business world. The urban catch phrase for it goes like this: If you think it's unfair, try starting your own business. See how difficult and stressing that is. Well, in fact there are many aspects to it:

First, a business is only risky in the beginning. After that it's constant profit until it is not anymore in which case you can just drop it.

Second, the workers are not actually shielded from any risk. Actually they are the first line of facing the consequences. The workers get laid off as loose their livelihood as soon as the situation gets rough. The employer is actually the last person that leaves! On top of that, when a business is new or is failing, the employer always finds reasons to delay the payment, reduce from it, or not to pay at all.

Third, when you are wealthy enough, it is never a risk. You invest in multiple business and a number of them are guaranteed to succeed by sheer statistics and you are never actually at any risk. And the fact is, that major of the economy is governed by such wealthy people.

Forth, risk is part of the nature and reality and we should embrace it. It is not a secret anymore that the most important key characteristic of successful people is that they are comfortable with taking risks. It's simple. You fail quite a few times. Each time you learn something new. Eventually you will succeed and be prosperous. That's how learning and growing works.

In summary, paid laborers are never actually shielded from the risks of economy. The real world has risks and little work brings much more fortune than you (the tricked) would expect. But by using the fear in making risking, the abusive individuals take the merit of our work and dump even more risks in our lives.

## Private ownership

This is mine. That is yours. They say private ownership is one of the most fundamental parts of human nature. I can not argue with that. What I am going to argue about is how much a person can or has the right to own?

Imagine everyone in the world transfer the ownership of whatever they have to a person called Steve. Steve can now rule the world. Steve will decide whether you will have a roof over your head or not. Or whether you can die of hunger or not. And it's not right for us to not follow his wish because it is his private property and he has the right over it. Doesn't it sound broken? I have to break it to you. We are living in such a world.

Capitalism says Steve can own and buy as much as he wants. Even the stuff he doesn't need or will only use maybe once or twice in his entire life. So maybe a Steve that will own the world will practically never happen, but right now we have millions and millions of mini-Steves that in their own limited version are controlling the lives of multitude of people. Now don't jump to Soviet Union on me! All I'm saying is that the capitalism version of private ownership does not work for whoever is not Steve i.e. most of the planet's population. Of course if you have a few mega-Steves writing the rules or controlling how the rules are written, it is unlikely that this issue will be addressed and resolved. Note that if you are feeling like a Steve just know that there is always a bigger Steve controlling your life as well. And if your name is Steve, I'm sorry for using your name!

The solution will come much further in the article but for this subject's case: Maybe we could establish that what you don't need anymore is not yours anymore. And what you need, is automatically yours. And if there is a limit in resources, maybe we can decide ownership by how much it is deserved and not just leave it to Steve to decide. If Steve can control someone else's life for even the tiniest bit, in that bit we are missing democracy. If we have 0.01% super mega Steves, we are missing democracy for that much.

#### Ownership over the work of others

What is even worse than private ownership of things, is ownership over someone else's work. It basically means that whatever you do and whatever value you generate from what you have done, belongs to someone else. This creates the kind of inequality that no matter how hard you work, you feel minimum difference in your quality of life while someone else is having everything without doing anything.

This kind of ownership is defined in Capitalism as "companies". The owners of the company own whatever the value the employees generate and the employees are paid a minimum wage. It is the minimum possible by nature of this kind of ownership. Because the employees' collective work is generating all the income, basically the owner's profit is whatever he gets not to pay you (from the value your work has generated). Note that even the CEO of a company is an employee. The owners or shareholders just buy the shares and they don't have to do anything.

#### If the world was loyal, your turn would never come

Private ownership is unstable in nature. Picture the current state of the world. It is filled with rich companies and rich people constantly becoming more and more rich. Bigger companies buy smaller companies or force them out of the market.

Putting aside why they just want to own more stuff all the time, this pattern has repeated itself so many times throughout the history. The royals and the lords wanted more lands, the colonialists wanted to colonize more and now the companies also want to have more.

But can things continue progressing like this forever? At some point so many things will be owned by so few people and in the mean time so many people will have almost nothing. It has always happened. The result is a majority who is obviously very unhappy and fundamentally more powerful than the few. So sooner or later, at some point, a coup or a revolution will take place and the wealth will be redistributed again.

Ownership over things is actually just an illusion. The world does not make things entitled to you. Ownership only lives in our minds. The land that you are living on right now probably belonged to a native resident or a lord that was taken from them. And that lord most likely took it from someone else in a previous dynasty. And so on. If the entitlement where to be kept, all of us would be slaves right now (in case everything were inherited like in a kingdom) or all of us equally entitled to everything (in case things would be distributed equally between someone's children).

Ask yourself this: How did things first got owned by someone? How did the first people got entitled to ownership of something? Because they were born on the land? Because they were first to claim the ownership? And then the ownership just stick with them forever? How about the next person that is born? Will that person own nothing now because the earth is covered by people and everything is claimed already? And why should the predecessors have control over these things? Are they more human than their children?

The truth is, just because you exist, you are entitled to enjoy your existence as much as every other being. And have access to resources just like everyone else. It must never depend on whether your birth givers owned many lands or were living on a rented land. The "ownership" bit is the flaw.

## Money

What if there was no money? Think about it, the same exact world that we are living in but suddenly the next day it is announced that no longer money is required to get stuff. You can just go to the store and pick up whatever you want. What would happen?

The immediate response is usually "no one will go to work" or "all the cars in the car shops will be immediately taken". My response is that you are mostly right. But it will be because the world will immediately transform into something different. These changes might seem negative but if you look at it from the perspective of the new world that has been created are actually very positive and every one in the new world will end up happier than the previous one. Let me tackle these 2 cases one by one:

#### No one will go to work

So what does it mean when someone suddenly decides not to go to work when they don't need to anymore? Will you not go to work if you liked your job and you were being treated with respect and appreciated and also you didn't have some other emergency in life that you had to attend to? Of course you would, because then you would be where you want to be. And here is the point. Is it a bad thing that some people decide not to go to work if they are not forced to? Is it bad to not force you to do what you don't like to do? It's actually a good thing. In this new world, you can not force anyone to do anything. Your only option is to make people interested in the job or rather how to find the people who are actually interested and also how you treat them so that they like the working environment. Isn't this exactly what every person wants?

You might say some people are inherently lazy and the society will break down because people will just do nothing. On this argument I disagree with you. The psychology sciences have already established that a healthy person needs to feel useful in the society. To help other people and receive their appreciation acknowledges your existence and value in the society which reflects to your own sense of value. In fact, only people with severe cases of depression are even able to be useless to others. In which case it should be treated as a disease and therapists which are now free! can help a lot in this.

There might also be jobs that no one wants to do. Like mining. Which many people are required for it but maybe very few are actually interested in it. So what do you prefer? To force a portion of our population to do something we don't want to do or find another solution for it? Like make it rewarding enough for those who accept to take on the undesired work or do this job in rotation so no single undesiring person has to spend for than say 2 months there. Actually miners have been in the heart of many revolutions because of the sheer unfair working conditions that they have been in. It made sense to them and also makes sense to me, to treat them at heroes of the society. When money and power is no longer at play, it can be guaranteed that those people will be treated and rewarded fairly for the sacrifices they do for others.

#### All the cars in the car shops will be immediately taken

Sure! If you need a car, take one. But it also removes the sense of privilege around owning a car. So maybe later some people will realize they don't need a car as much and want to get rid of it. Or maybe there are actually less cars than are required. Then what do you prefer? To limit access to cars based on money and just condemn a portion of population to have a lower quality of life or find another solution for this problem? Maybe we need more car production facilities since now without money, there is no limit on customer and no cost on increasing the production. Does it hurt the planet then? Maybe we need to redesign our cities and transportation so that there is less need for cars. Especially now that holding patents and brands no longer makes sense, I am sure we can get together and find very interesting solutions. In some cases we might just be out of solutions. Say, everyone wants to do a space walk or wear clothes made out of gold! For this, I prefer us to come up with a necessity factor and prioritize access to limited resources based on how much it is needed. Do you prefer the person with the money to have the car or the person who lacks legs and can not walk?

#### Can you imagine a world with money?

Now let's imagine the reverse. Let's see what a person from a world without money would think when presented with the idea of a world with money:

- When people solve a problem they wouldn't want to share the solution with others because they would want to profit from it. Life saving ideas would take years to reach everyone.
- A lot of resources and human effort would be wasted because each problem will be solved multiple times. Imagine multiple companies trying to create spaceships that can land and not helping each other.
- The focus would be diverted from helping people to profiting from them. Politicians would lie for money. Brands will do their best to distract people into using their products.
- If someone for some reason is not able to work for a while, they would suffer a lot. We would have a concept of poverty!!!
- Producers would be motivated to make products that have a short life on purpose. Which will pollute the environment and increase the poverty since people will have to pay multiple times for the same thing.

## Religion

I believe all religions do more evil than they do good. I know this very phrase brings up negative emotions and in some cases makes you want to make me not exist anymore! If so, you are actually helping my case. Let me explain.

I define religion as a set of beliefs and behavioral instructions that are packaged under a name like Christianity or Islam. And people are born with different religions and sometimes "convert" to a new one. My argument is, no matter what religion promotes or whether what it says is right or wrong, having a religion inherently guarantees more evil to take place than good.

#### No two people think exactly the same way

No two people think and see the world exactly the same way. This is a fact in psychology. Each person has unique experiences and unique genetics and it means that we perceive the world in different ways. The very fact that we have multiple belief systems point to this. You can be sure everyone means well, yet we can not agree on various things. Hence the idea that you can have a set of beliefs shared between multiple people is false. These beliefs are either transferred from person to person or from a book. Both cases are subject to each person's interpretation of them. You can have 2 religious leaders with the same religion on the same sect and the same urban background and they could still argue even about fundamental beliefs.

That's why no one can ever be truly labeled as a believer in a religion. What ever it is that makes you be considered a believer, it can never be clearly defined what it is. With one exception: You give up trying to understand the beliefs and just be like "I believe in whatever that that person I look up to believes in". Because while trying to learn the religion you continuously keep making mistakes and misunderstandings. In fact, you are not making mistakes, it's just that you perceive the world differently from the person who is teaching you. But by thinking that you are making mistakes you are led to a point that you just accept the words in, without truly understanding them. Up to this point 2 bad things has happened. Firstly you always feel guilty and incomplete in your heart. Secondly you are led to following a person rather than a religion. Again, because you can't really define and fit the religion but you can always follow and repeat another person. Following another person is bad because that person is basically someone like you, and they can also make mistakes. But this time a personal mistake can have a magnitude to the number of people who are following. Sometimes you believe in a person you don't know because someone you know believes in them, it's also the same mistake repeated twice if you think about it.

#### Separation from others

By labeling yourself as a believer in a religion, you are joining a group and automatically separating from everyone else. Everyone with a different religion will immediately become a foreigner to you. And also someone misguided because you truly believe you are on the divine path. It will be automatically harder to love others and forgive their mistakes and reverse of it for your group. It will promote tribal behavior which is one of the root causes for conflict and injustice.

#### Morality and the religion

No matter which religion you have, you love it because you believe it makes you a better person for yourself and the people around you. It's like your morality, your inner light is telling you it's a good thing. And how do we know that our religion is good? Because we know we are good and our religious leader is also good. The morality takes precedence. Do we really need our religion to tell us what is right and wrong then? Here comes the issue of deciding on the morality of complex and complicated matters. A religion is supposed to solve this for us. Just a set of instructions for various conditions which if you follow, you can make sure it's fine. Here is the thing, a religion can make mistakes on what is moral. Because in the end it has been passed down to you through different mediums and one mistake along the passage can result in a different interpretation. I am just saying a religious ruling "can" be a mistake but if you keep your moralities in your pocket, you can always measure if it sounds right or wrong.

#### Think for yourself

I said all of the above assuming that your religion, whatever it is, has a divine source. Honestly, I don't think an all knowing divine entity would ever put a name on their guidelines because of the negative effects I just told you about. Imagine Muslims and Christians and Jews have been fighting and killing each other over Jerusalem for more than a thousand years. All of them basically believe in the same God and the same values of being nice to one another. If no name for your beliefs existed, they would actually be very close to each other. God wouldn't make such a mistake! The problem arises when we put a name on what we believe in. The believers of Jesus Christ's teachings named themselves Christians. Jesus would prefer them to keep the teachings and not become blind followers of him and call themselves Christians!

The ideas in this article are also presented in a conversation format which helps you always remember that a person prune to making mistakes has made these arguments. I would also prefer you to think about my arguments rather than follow this text which every single person will interpret in a different way.

# Picturing the problem

## Capitalism

Most of the time, the first and strongest argument pro capitalisms use is that the "free market" agenda of capitalism ensures freedom, creativity and optimization. Point is, free market is the only right pillar of capitalism and the main reason it has worked so well. What makes capitalism problematic is "private ownership" and "wage labor". Because they open the door for abuse and tyranny as is previously discussed under "what is wrong".

The combination of the 3 pillars of capitalism and the definition of money, raise more complex problems that are products of mixing in multiple kinds of wrongs together. These more complex problems are described here.
