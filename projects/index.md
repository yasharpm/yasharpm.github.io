## LetsTip
*June 28th 2022*

### Overview
A donation website with zero fees and direct donation delivery. We rely on donations for our income.

### Technical overview
Donations are received via crypto token purchase APIs. The donors are not exposed to the crypto side at all. Behind the scences, the donor is actually buying crypto directly to the wallet of their receipient.

### Marketing strategy
Through negotiations with the crypto gateway provider we can cover the exchange fees. Meaning if $1 leaves the donors bank account, $1 will sit in the recipients wallet. There is hope that this generates exitement about the service and we can cover this cost through the donation money we receive.

For actual marketing, the plan is to start with Russian English content creators (due to sanctions on Russia they are having a difficult life). Starting with a few, we keep improving the product and inviting them to introduce the service to more of their community until we reach a point we can actually spend on advertisements.

### Current status
One of the Russian content creators I contacted has shown interest. Waiting for his reply.

## Iran online gate
*June 28th 2022*

### Overview
A website which provides access to Iranian websites and services which otherwise are restricted from abroad due to IP banning or banking limitations.

### Technical overview
We receive payments through a crypto gateway. This way, sanction laws are not broken.

### Marketing strategy
Different types of products like Iranian streaming subscriptions or online shop credits are provided in the website for sale. We can go as far as providing bill payments and phone credit top ups.

The target users are Iranians living abroad. Iranians in different countries and cities have specific gathering online locations. We introduce our services through those channels. Most of which are expected to be free to advertise.

### Current status
Atena is preparing a questionnaire to determine in demand services. Meanwhile Pedram is preparing the list of Iranian online gathering locations to post the questionnaire there.
